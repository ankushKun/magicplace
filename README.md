**⚔️ Attack & Earn**

- **Cooldowns**: Visitors have a cooldown (30s after 100 pixels).

## ✨ Tech Highlights

**⚡ Instant & Gasless**
Powered by **MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups**, every pixel is placed instantly (0s latency) with no gas fees for the user. Includes **Session Keys** so you only sign once.  
The only fees you pay are for shard account initialization on solana base layer (~0.05 SOL per shard) if you create shards, else placing pixels in other peoples shards is free.

**📡 Real-Time**
Every change streams live to all players globally via **Magicblocks**.
